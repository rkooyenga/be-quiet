## Be Quiet
Script experiments to limit ads and distracting content. Tell websites to chill tf out and be quiet.

### What
A guy can only take so many sounds from the CPU and so many machine hangs from connecting to a trillion ad servers just to read a few sentences on the typical blog or news site. 

### Why
From the noisy epilepsy attack sites to the slow ad serving and data slurping junk sites, it's clearly an era where minimalist distraction free zen products are more than trends they are a necessity to stay focused and your machine as well not hanging. 

Reader mode? Adblock? Some combination of the two? 

Yes, exactly. I agree and so when you click on something that is a original or exclusive source you need to reference but is problematic and you dont have available an adblocker because Gooogle banned them, or a reader mode, these are experiments to accomplish one or both. 

Primarily just quieting the page is the goal there are more robust solutions for adblocking, make a big hosts file of ad servers for instance. These are just personal use things I'm storing to not lose track and obviously sharing with whoever else is curious at the same time. 

### How do you run them?
1. Paste into Devtools console
2. Prepend with ``javascript:`` then execute in address bar
3. Prepend with ``javascript:`` then save as a bookmark or favorite on your Chrome bookmarks toolbar to execute easily whenever you want.

I have personally a folder of bookmark scripts as one of my first bookmarks on that bar. And in it about 5 versions of these different be-quiet scripts. some work better but for certain sites or issues and its not important enough to try and consolidate, or make a real product focused on usability out of it. Also leaving here just because the different approaches employed may be helpful to reference later if I did make a adblock or reader mode, or other side of the table get back to pushing adtech and or ad metrics and seeing what frustrates a user and how I or my customer mightbe circumvented if we are overly obnoxious in popups for instance.

### Which one to use? 
Varies. But my notes say I have best results with bequiet_v2
