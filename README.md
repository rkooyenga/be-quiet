## Be Quiet
Script experiments to limit ads and distracting content. Tell websites to chill tf out and be quiet.

### What
A guy can only take so many sounds from the CPU and so many machine hangs from connecting to a trillion ad servers just to read a few sentences on the typical blog or news site. 

### Why
From the noisy epilepsy attack sites to the slow ad serving and data slurping junk sites, it's clearly an era where minimalist distraction free zen products are more than trends they are a necessity to stay focused and your machine as well not hanging. Reader mode? Adblock? Some combination of the two? Yes, exactly. I agree and so when you click on something that is a 1:1 original source you need to reference and dont want to use or maybe dont have available an adblocker because Gooogle banned them, or a reader mode for whatever reason, these are experiments to accomplish one or both. They are just personal use things I'm storing to not lose track and obviously sharing with whoever else is curious at the same time. 

### How do you run them?
Paste into fevtools console or prepend with ``javascript:`` then execute in address bar or save them as a favorite on your chrome bar to execute that way whenever you want. Then just click to run. I have personally a folder of bookmark scripts as one of my first bookmarks on the favorite bar and in it about 5 versions of these didfferent ones work best for different sites and its not important enough to try and consolidate or make a real product focused on usability out of it. IT sort of chronicles my thinking and approaches though so I'm leaving here just because.

### Which one to use? 
Varies. But my notes say I have best results with bequiet_v2
